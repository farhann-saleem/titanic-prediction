# Titanic Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using various algorithms.

## Project Structure
- `prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for data analysis and modeling.
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`: Titanic dataset files.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Install required Python packages (see notebook for details).
2. Open `prediction.ipynb` and follow the analysis step by step.

## Main Steps

- Data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Model training (Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM)
- Model evaluation and comparison
